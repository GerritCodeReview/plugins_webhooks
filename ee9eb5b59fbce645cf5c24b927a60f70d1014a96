      "message": "I get the idea but IMHO unfortunately this is not enough:\n1. both cfg and remote name are needed in order to give task a chance to read additional configuration parameters otherwise it would resolve to tedious walk over config and comparing URLs\n2. I am not sure if scheduling execution to decide later if it even makes sense to post is not to costly - I like method `shouldPost` but IMHO decision about posting or not should happen in processor (we are for instance adding parameter that enables posting of `refs/meta` - by default it is \u0027false\u0027 for us) - and having sth like 2 steps `should I post` check doesn\u0027t sound too good to me",
